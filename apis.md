description: Google AdWords is an online advertising service developed by Google,
  where advertisers pay to display brief advertising copy, product listings, and video
  content within the Google ad network to web users. Google AdWords system is based
  partly on cookies and partly on keywords determined by advertisers. Google uses
  these characteristics to place advertising copy on pages where they think it might
  be relevant. Advertisers pay when users divert their browsing to click on the advertising
  copy. Partner websites receive a portion of the generated income.
